In this project, I built a website using the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client, that integrates the JokeAPI. 
The website interacts with the API, retrieves data, and presents it in a user-friendly manner. 
I used the JokeAPI to create a website that gives the user a joke based on their name.
